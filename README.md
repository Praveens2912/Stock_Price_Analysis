## üìä Interactive Dashboard

A fully interactive **Stock Price Analysis Dashboard** was developed using **Streamlit**.  
This dashboard provides an easy-to-navigate interface for exploring stock performance, trends, and correlations in real-time.  
Users can filter companies, adjust timeframes, and view analytical charts directly from their browser.

###  **Dashboard Features**
-  **Stock Price Trends** ‚Äì Interactive line charts showing daily and cumulative price changes.  
-  **Moving Average Comparison** ‚Äì Select between 7-day, 30-day, and 90-day moving averages to observe trend shifts.  
-  **Correlation Matrix** ‚Äì Explore the relationships among major tech stocks (Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft).  
-  **Volatility & Daily Returns** ‚Äì Visual breakdown of daily performance and risk levels.  
-  **Company Selection** ‚Äì Choose specific stocks to visualize and compare side by side.

### üåê **Dashboard Access**

Since Streamlit runs locally during development, you can launch the dashboard by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Once the server starts, open your browser and visit:

[http://localhost:8502/](http://localhost:8503/)
